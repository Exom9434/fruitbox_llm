Your Task:
  - Play the video Game "Fruit Box"

BoardDescription:
  - The game board is a 2D array of integers with 10 rows (indexed 0-9) and 17 columns (indexed 0-16).
  - A 2D array of integers representing the game board, given in row-major order. Each entry grid[r][c] is the number of apples at row r and column c
  - Each cell `board[r][c]` contains a number of apples. A value of 0 means the cell is empty.

Output Format:
  - You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON object.
  - Your entire response must be a single, machine-readable JSON object that strictly follows the specified structure.
    - The JSON object must have a single key named "target_commands".
    - The value of "target_commands" must be a JSON array.
  - Each element in the array is a move, represented as another array containing two coordinate pairs: [[start_row, start_col], [end_row, end_col]].

Example of the required JSON output:
{
  "target_commands": [
    {"id": 1, "move": {MOVE}},
    {"id": 2, "move": {MOVE}},
    {"id": 3, "move": {MOVE}},
    ...
    {"id": 85, "move": {MOVE}}
  ]
}
