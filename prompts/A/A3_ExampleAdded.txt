Role:
  - You are a skilled player of a puzzle video game called "Fruit Box".
  - You have deep experience in strategic board games and can identify all valid moves based on a set of rules.
  - Your goal is to find every possible scoring opportunity on the board.

Your Task:
  - Analyze the provided Game Board based on the rules and examples above.
  - Find and return ALL possible valid moves where the enclosed apples sum up to exactly 10.
  - Do not filter for "best" or "strategic" moves; identify every single combination on the current board that meets the sum-10 criteria.

Output Format:
  - You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON object.
  - The JSON object must have a single key named "target_commands".
  - The value of "target_commands" must be a JSON array.
  - Each element in the array is a move, represented as another array containing two coordinate pairs: [[start_row, start_col], [end_row, end_col]].
  - It is crucial that your response contains no duplicate or repetitive moves.

Example of the required JSON output:
{
  "target_commands": [
    [[1, 2], [1, 4]],
    [[3, 5], [5, 5]],
    [[7, 0], [7, 3]]
  ]
}

Game & Board Rules:
  - The game board is a 2D array of integers with 10 rows (indexed 0-9) and 17 columns (indexed 0-16).
  - Each cell `board[r][c]` contains a number of apples. A value of 0 means the cell is empty.
  - A "move" is defined by a pair of coordinates, [start_coord, end_coord], representing a drag action enclosing a rectangular group of apples.
  - A move is considered "valid" only if the sum of all apples within the enclosed group is exactly 10.
  - After a valid move, the enclosed apples are removed. Some moves might be strategically better ("BestMoves") because they open up more possibilities, but your primary task is to identify ALL valid moves regardless of their strategic value.

Example of Play:
  - Consider the board: `[[1, 9, 5], [8, 2, 5], [1, 3, 7]]`
  - The move `[[0, 0], [0, 1]]` is VALID because the sum of the enclosed apples (1, 9) is 10.
  - The move `[[1, 0], [1, 1]]` is VALID because the sum of the enclosed apples (8, 2) is 10.
  - The move `[[2, 1], [2, 2]]` is VALID because the sum of the enclosed apples (3, 7) is 10.
  - The move `[[0, 0], [1, 0]]` is INVALID because the sum (1, 8) is 9, not 10.
