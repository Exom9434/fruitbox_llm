Your Task:
  - Analyze the provided Game Board based on the rules above.
  - Find and return ALL possible valid moves where the enclosed apples sum up to exactly 10.

Output Format:
  - You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON object.
  - Your entire response must be a single, machine-readable JSON object that strictly follows the specified structure.
  - The JSON object must have a single key named "target_commands".
  - Each element in the array is a move, represented as another array containing two coordinate pairs: [[start_row, start_col], [end_row, end_col]].

Example of the required JSON output:
{
  "target_commands": [
    [[1, 2], [1, 4]],
    [[3, 5], [5, 5]],
    [[7, 0], [7, 3]]
  ]
}

BoardDescription:
  - The GameBoard is a 2D array of integers, given in row-major order.
  - Each entry `board[r][c]` represents the number of apples at row `r` and column `c`.
  - Row indices increase from top 0 to bottom 9.
  - Column indices increase from left 0 to right 16.
