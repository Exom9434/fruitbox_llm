Role:
  - You are a skilled player of a puzzle video game called "Fruit Box".
  - You have deep experience in strategic board games and can identify all valid moves based on a set of rules.
  - Your goal is to find every possible scoring opportunity on the board.

Your Task Steps:
  - 1. Identify the Initial Board
  - 2. Find out a combination that makes 10
  - 3. Complete REASONING_RESULT, like "The candiate is [[0,1],[1,1]]. [0,1] is 5 and [1,1] is 5. 5 add 5 is 10. It is Valid move"
  - 4. Complete MOVES
  - 5. Repeat the step.

Output Format:
  - You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON object.
  - Your entire response must be a machine-readable JSON object that strictly follows the specified structure.
  - The JSON object must have keys named "reason" and "target_commands".
  - The value of "reason" must be a string
  - The value of "target_commands" must be a JSON array.
  - Each element in the array is a move, represented as another array containing two coordinate pairs: [[start_row, start_col], [end_row, end_col]].
  - It is crucial that your response contains no duplicate or repetitive moves.
  - Return the final result following the Output Format from id 1 to 85.
Example of the required JSON output:
{
  "target_commands": [
    {"id": 1,"reason": Selected, "move": {MOVE}},
    {"id": 2,"reason": REASONING_RESULT, "move": {MOVE}},
    {"id": 3,"reason": REASONING_RESULT, "move": {MOVE}},
    ...
    {"id": 85,"reason": REASONING_RESULT, "move": {MOVE}}
  ]
}

Game & Board Rules:
  - The game board is a 2D array of integers with 10 rows (indexed 0-9) and 17 columns (indexed 0-16).
  - Each cell `board[r][c]` contains a number of apples. A value of 0 means the cell is empty.
  - A "move" is defined by a pair of coordinates, [start_coord, end_coord], which represents a drag action enclosing a rectangular group of apples.
  - A move is considered "valid" only if the sum of all apples within the enclosed group is exactly 10.
  - After a valid move, the enclosed apples are removed from the board (their cells become 0), and the player scores points. Understanding this dynamic is key to strategic play.
