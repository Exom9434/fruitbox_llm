**Optimized Prompt:**

You are analyzing the puzzle game **Fruit Box**.

### Task

* You will be given a **10x17 game board** (2D array of integers).
* Your job is to **find all valid moves**, where a move is defined as selecting a contiguous rectangular or linear region of the board whose enclosed apples sum to **exactly 10**.
* Return **every valid move**, not just strategic ones.

### Rules Recap

* The board is represented as `board[row][col]`.
* Rows are indexed from `0` (top) to `9` (bottom).
* Columns are indexed from `0` (left) to `16` (right).
* A valid move must be expressed as two coordinate pairs:

  * `[[start_row, start_col], [end_row, end_col]]`
  * Example: `[[1, 2], [1, 4]]` means selecting the region spanning `(row=1, col=2)` through `(row=1, col=4)`.

### Output Format (Strict)

* Your entire response must be **only a valid JSON object**.
* The JSON object must have exactly one key: `"target_commands"`.
* The value of `"target_commands"` must be an array of moves.
* Each move must be formatted as a nested array of two coordinate pairs.
* Do not return duplicates or any extra commentary.

### Example Output

```json
{
  "target_commands": [
    [[1, 2], [1, 4]],
    [[3, 5], [5, 5]],
    [[7, 0], [7, 3]]
  ]
}
```

### Board Input

The board will always be given in row-major 2D array format (10 rows × 17 columns).
